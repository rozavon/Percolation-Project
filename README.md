# Percolation-Project
In a system of rectangular/square NxN  grid cells or sites.
  All sites start as blocked
  When a site is chosen at random it is open
  Open sites connected to the top row are full.
  A system in which there's a full cell in the bottom row (and thus a path of full cells from top to bottom) percolates.
  
In this project I write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation. In doing so, I better understand depth-first-search, union-find structures, and the use of computer simulations for statistical inquiry.
